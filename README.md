# LinuxSharedMemoryAndDCAFExample
This example LabVIEW Real-Time (LVRT) application will use NI Scan Engine on NI CompactRIO (cRIO) for scanned hardware I/O data access, and enable access to the data by creating Linux shared memory as the interface to other processes. The LVRT application will use the Distributed Control and Automation Framework (DCAF), and implement a semaphore Linux IPC mechanism as a timing signal to enable synchronous execution of a complimenting example C application. The example C and LVRT applications will run in parallel, sharing data between them on the NI Linux RT cRIO target.
